# Respecc++

## Brief Description
Respecc++ is a programming language designed to promote good manners and proper etiquette in our degenerate society. Many programmers nowadays view computers as tools rather than partners. When a cryptic error message is shown, programmers mutter curses and ask the compiler, "What the HECK are you doing today...?" Yet nobody ever asks the compiler, "How are you doing today?" We find this state of affairs to be deplorable, and we hope the creation of Respecc++ will improve human-computer interactions for years to come.

Although slightly more verbose than some modern languages, Respecc++ boasts an incredibly readable (and respectful) syntactic structure. Additionally, the compiler keeps track of whether any written program is civil or rude and assigns it a numerical value. Considerate code means that at compile time, everything is hunky-dory. However, if a programmer cuts too many corners with "rude" code, the compiler will remember that, *and we cannot promise anything good will come of making the compiler your enemy.*
